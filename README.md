**Zephiles** for their numerous code contributions. These include:

  based on
* The current REL loader Gecko code
* A custom heap implementation for the mod

**PistonMiner** for their [ttyd-tools](https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools) framework, which provides everything
you need to turn C++ into a .GCI savefile which can be loaded into a Gamecube game at runtime. In addition, thanks very
much for the detailed answers to my romhacking-related questions.

**CraftedCart** for their substantial contributions to the Monkey Ball 2 decompile project, as well as the many large
contributions to the Monkey Ball hacking and custom level scene on the whole.

Super Monkey Ball 2.

**TheBombSquad** for their decompile contributions as well, and for writing the current version of the ISO REL loader.

**Alist** and **PetresInc** for providing insightful feedback on a pre-release alpha needed before publishing an initial
